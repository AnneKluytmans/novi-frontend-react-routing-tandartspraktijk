# ðŸª¥ React Router Exercise: Tandartspraktijk de Tandenborstel â€“ NOVI Frontend Module

This repository contains my solution for the React Router exercise from the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).  
The goal of this assignment is to practice implementing **client-side routing** in React by using **React Router Dom** to create a multi-page website for a fictional dental practice.

The app demonstrates how to set up routes, use navigation links with active styling, and handle programmatic navigation with event handlers.
